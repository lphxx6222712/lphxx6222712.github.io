I'm currenctly a postdoc research fellow at HMS/MGH. My research interest lies in applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for novel MRI acquisition, reconstruction, processing, and analysis. The specific research topics include AI-based RF pulse design, rapid MRI reconstruction, and multi-modal MRI image segmentation. That is to bridge state-of-art AI and the demand for MRI research.
